						<p>In <i>Shadow the Hedghehog</i> the player is given the choice to choose their own adventure, with a total of 326 paths the player can take each having different story beats. However not all of these paths are canon, as in many major characters such as Dr. Eggman die and in others Shadow vows to destroy the planet. If future titles are anything to go by both of these are not true however at this time while we know and it has been confirmed the game happened exactly <i>what</i> happened is unclear outside of the following:</p>
						<h3>Resources:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/List_of_Shadow_the_Hedgehog_Library_sequences">Library (Source of Path Names)</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@goodcowgames/search?query=shadow%20the%20hedgehog">Cutscenes</a></li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Given Events:</h3>
							<p>These are the events implied to have happened during <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i> by proceeding games in the franchise.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Westopolis:</b> During the games events, Westopolis is devastated by the Black Arms.</li>
								<li><b>Digital Circuit:</b> GUN's Mainframe - which is canonically compromised by Shadow who seeks to obtain the digitized Chaos Emerald inside.</li>
								<li><b>Leathal Highway & Central City:</b> Shadow did the Hero Missions in these levels as GUN was able to drive the Black Arms out of Westopolis.</li>
								<li><b>Dr. Eggman:</b> As Sonic States in the IDW Comics <a href="#sh1">[sh1]</a> - Dr. Eggman canonically assisted them during the Black Arms invasion by sending the Egg Fleet which engages Black Doom's Warships seen in Glypic Canyon.<a href="#sh2">[sh2]</a>.</li>
								<li><b>Glyphic Canyon:</b> Given the above this likely means the Dark Mission happened - however Shadow was not present for it as he "Won't be Black Doom's puppet". This implies that Black Doom carried the Dark Mission out on this level by himself using the Black Arms.</li>
								<li><b>GUN & The President:</b> The President and Abraham Towers arrives at GUN HQ safely, meaning the events of Air Fleet and GUN Fortress occured whilst Shadow wasn't present. Diablon was never deployed as te GUN Commander would only deploy it if Shadow sided with the Black Arms which he hasn't.</li>
								<li><b>Intermission:</b> This means that whatever path is the canon one has to hit these story beats or in the case of events where Shadow wasn't present - imply it's happening in the background.</li>
								<li><b>Final Story:</b> We know for a fact this happened as in Sonic X Shadow Generations:Dark Beginnings, Abraham says that Shadow saved the world from Black Doom <a href="#sh3">[sh3]</a>  - which he does by destroying the Black Comet in Last Story.</li>
								<li><b>Expert Mode:</b> We also know that Abraham and Shadow reconcile their differences as seen by Abraham's Actions and Words in Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings by giving Shadow the Rocket he needed to reach the ARK.<a href="#sh3">[sh3]</a> This reconciliation can be seen in Shadow the Hedgehog's Expert Mode - which would make it canon.<a href="#sh4">[sh4]</a></li>
								<li><b>Expert Mode:</b> This mode also reveals that the Artifical Chaos became hostile after Emerl's attack on the ARK <a href="#sh5">[sh6]</a> - though the details aren't quite right as Gerald Robotnik's Journal reveals the truth <a href="#sh6">[sh6]</a>.</li>
							</ul>
						<h3>Notes:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Last Story:</b> The Last Story depicts Shadow on the Black Comet having all 7 Chaos Emeralds and Abraham Towers in GUN HQ with the President. Due to this we can confirm that Shadow did not fight Sonic & Daiblon, and any path not ending in the levels stated being non-canon.</li>
							<li><b>Last Story + Future Games:</b> The Last Story and future games in the series depicts Dr. Eggman being alive and well - this means Shadow did not fight Dr. Eggman at the end of his journey as in every instance of such confrontation aside from the one in Comsic Fall - Shadow takes Dr. Eggman's life.</li>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings:</b> <i>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings</i> backs this as it treats this as Shadow's first trip to the Space Colony Ark since the events of <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> this means that Shadow canonically did not visit the Space Colony ARK in <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i>.</li>
									<li><b>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings:</b> <i>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings</i> reveals that Shadow and Abraham have reconciled - this is seen in the game's Expert Mode.</li>
									<li><b>Possibility:</b> While the Dr. Eggman CG Cutscene is what can be interpreted as what Sonic is referring to it may also be that this cutscene happens at the beginning of the story (likely after Shadow's Westopolis)</li>
								</ul>
							<li><b>IDW Comics:</b> Sonic notes in the IDW Comics that Dr. Eggman assisted them during the Black Arms invasion - given this it's likely that the cutscene where Dr. Eggman mobilizes his forces is canon. Given that Sky Troops is a continuation of Glyphic Canyon that would give us the following route working from the last stage back to the first: Sky Troops (Hero)> Space Gadget (Hero) > Final Haunt (Hero) > Black Doom > Last Way > Devil Doom</li>
							<li><b>Shadow the Hedgehog:</b> Shadow's Opening Dialoue and Abraham Towers Post-Westopolis cutscene imply the canon mission for the level to be the Dark Mission - this means Shadow has canonically killed GUN Soldiers with Abraham Towers ordering them to hunt down Shadow. This would give us the following path: Westopolis (Dark) > Digital Circuit (???) > ... > Sky Troops (Hero) > Space Gadget (Hero) > Final Haunt (Hero) > Last Way > Devil Doom</li>
							<li><b>Shadow the Hedgehog + Last Story:</b> Amy appears in the Last Story segment but only appears in Cryptic Castle where she's trying to find Cream and Cheese.</li>
							<li><b>Shadow the Hedgehog + Last Story:</b> Shadow beats Dr. Eggman's Terminal to get it to work - this is what inspires charmy to do the same in the Last Story which plays Gerald's Message to Shadow. However this cutscene only plays after Prison Island (Hero) which sends you to Mad Matrix</li>
							<li><b>Conclusion:</b>This being said this brings us down to 3 paths possible to be canon those being:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Route 44 - Miracle of Love (DDHHH-H)</li>
								<li>Route 78 - Power of Love (DHNHH-H)</li>
								<p>and...</p>
								<li>Route 90 - Shining Within Memory... (DHHNH-H)</li>
							</ul>

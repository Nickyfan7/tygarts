				<hr/>
						<p>Welcome dear follower, investigator, or wanderer to my world, I hope you have plans to stay because you certainly won't be leaving... this is where I play my game, where I collect souls - there's just so many to play with yet so little time. Have faith though, one day your realm will be mine... then we can play together for eternity. My tale begins a long time ago - before you were even a thought, in a dimension outside space-time is an area known as the void. I was created as a result of primordial energies clashing together - a darkness made concious it was so quiet back then, and I admit, sometimes I miss the quiet. I wandered the void for what felt like millenia before I found something - a window and through it there it was blue, round and ready for conquering - Earth.</p>
						<p>Having nothing better to do I watched from my window as you mortals went about your daily lives, it was such a waste thinking whoever created you would kill you one day - why throw away such useful servants? Such great toys? As I watched however I soon saw one human somewhere in Japan, What was his name? Naoto Oshima? He was drawing something... it looked like a humanoid hedgehog of some kind. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in his idea. Such a form, if used properly could be used to trick prey, get their guard down before striking - I felt it perfect for my plans so I tried replicating it through the dark matter that surrounded me. I created many failed prototypes - one of them truly beliving that they could overthrow me, how cute. They were quickly humbled.</p>
						<p>Eventually, I managed to create it, the perfect vessel. Though initially it had a flaw - the eyes were a dead giveaway but it was nothing that couldn't be fixed in time soon I created a world based on the one that Hedgehog fellow resided in - though this time the vision was different. See, like I said before why waste such perfect servants? Such perfect toys? I needed a way - a way out a way into your world but doing so required a gateway - a connection. Luckily I found just the person to give me such a gateway - so I made a little "deal" with someone in your government I sent him instructions on a program capable of acting as a window and gateway to my dimension.</p>
						<p>In return he'd "get to play a game" - one he's still playing today, how much fun he must be having. <span style = "color:#333333"> H̵͕̅E̵̜͛Ĺ̷̤P̶͚̋ ̷̭͐H̸͈̚E̶̻͘L̷̪͝P̸̬͛ ̵̱̈́H̴̞̎Ė̶̫L̶̝͠P̴̋ͅ ̸̭̋H̸͓͂É̴L̴̗͋P̴̡̍ ̷̦̊Ḩ̸̎E̴͇͂L̴͎̄Ṕ̷̠ </span> Soon your planet would be mine, but I needed to make you aware so I had this Disc delivered to someone - many fell to my game with detectives trying to find me... how quaint. Eventually some came to see me as a GOD, as they rightfully should called themselves the "Cult of X" a name I'd adopt as their deity. Still it wasn't enough, they may have spread the disc around but if Earth is to be mine i'd need more souls - many more. So after one human GammaEpsilon had obtained it - I gave them orders... and now thanks to their efforts <i><b>even you dear friends</b></i> can play my game, can see my world - one of beauty, one of bloodshed, one of pain and suffering, a realm of divinity. So don't keep me waiting, I don't like to wait very long.</p>

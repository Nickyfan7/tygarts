		 <ul>
			<li>Connected Universes: If a universe is connected to another that means one of the two is a "Core Universe" and as such events seen in the connected universe have occured in the connected Core Universe.</li>
			<li>Linked Universes: If a universe is linked to another that means it may borrow elements of a linked universe, at the same time element of that universe may bleed into the core Sonic the Hedgehog Video Game Universe.</li>
			<li>Related Universes: If a universe is related that simply means it exists as part of the Sonic the Hedgehog Series - elements from the core SEGASonic the Hedgehog Universe may exist such as the Chaos Emeralds but the context, events, and rules of that universe may differ. No elements of these universes bleed into the core SEGASonic the Hedgehog Universe</li>

			<hr style="border: 2px dashed white;" />
				<ol>
					<li id ="ref1">The Sonic the Hedgehog Film Novelization reveals Sonic's Planet of Origin to be named "Mobius" - however due to a franchise-wide mandate put in place by SEGA using the name "Mobius" as the name of a planet is banned in the Sonic Franchise - this was due to an incident long ago involving the Archie Sonic Comics.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>While you cannot name a Planet in the Sonic Series "Mobius" but the Planet may be refered to simply as "Sonic's World" which the film elects to do.</li>
						<li>This mandate is part of a series of mandates that did not always exist - only being established due to a writer on the Archie Sonic the Hedgehog Comics. Before-hand Planets could be called "Mobius" and often were in western regions due to this - it can be argued that the name "Mobius" is less banned and more censored when used in the context of a Planetary Name in the Sonic Franchise.</li>
						<li>Given the Novelization has the original intended name of Sonic's Planet of Origin in the films as "Mobius" and there isn't an official name for the planet outside "Sonic's World" or "Sonic's Island" I decided to refer to the planet under the originally intended name.</li>
					</ul>
					<li id ="ref2">Jeff Fowler stated that in a deleted scene in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</i>, Gerald Robotnik would "Take a hit of a Shadow's Quill with the Chaos Energy inside it having a revitilizing effect" in esscence keeping Gerald alive to 110 Years of age.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Even though Jeff Fowler states that the scene was scrapped there are scenes in the final film where he is zapped by Shadow's Quill much in the same fashion as Ivo Robotnik is with Sonic's in the first 2 Films as such it's unclear if this plot element is still in play or not:<br/><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6qbVwVM8vFc?t=7"></iframe> </li>

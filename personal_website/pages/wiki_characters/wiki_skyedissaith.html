					<h3>Description<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"> </h3>
						<div class ="description">
							<p>Skye Eugine Dissaith is a Young Tiger Boy, who's in-tune with his own emotions alongside the emotions of others, being very introspective and often deep in thought. He feels things very deeply, both good and bad and is a natural healer. Skye carries a sense of empathy with him, able to understand how others feel, and relate to them based on similar experiences of his own, seeking to be genuinely and authentically himself.</p>
							<p>Skye may appear meek and shy but has a fire inside, often rushing to defend the underdog where he can. He carries a passion for his hobbies and things that speak to him. Despite this he can react emotionally at times, in extreme circumstances this can lead him to lash-out even if not his intention. He may also focus on his self-image a bit too much leeding to feelings of self-doubt, insecurity, and loss of control.</p>
							<p>All that said, Skye wants to be a good person as he has in his own words "seen the darkness in the world" - having been abused, "taken advantage of", witnessing death, and his loved ones also being "taken advantage of" in early childhood serves to fuel his empathy and fight for better days - even if he won't live to see those days.</p>

							<h3>Backstory<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"></h3>
								<p>Skye's Story begins at just 5 years old, having been taken from his Mother and Father - Keynn and Jakii Dissaith by the CPS where he'd be adopted by Brenda Agape. Whilst under her care Skye would be beaten, burned,gaslit, and manipulated. once having his head beaten against the bathtubwall until he bled before having it dunked underwater, held, and locked in the bathroom with a bucket of poison chemicals.</p>
								<p>In those days Skye was often sent to bed without being fed, and dressed poorly. As a result of this Skye didn't have many friends, as the kids at school would bully him relentlessly, the teachers often yelling at him due to his lack of focus. This left Skye feeling depresssed and doubtful he'd ever reunite with his birth parents, luckily for him an old colleage of Brenda's would show up bringing her child with her.</p>
								<p>The young fennec would introduce herself to him as "Andy" as the two would go upstairs and play with the young girl treating Skye with geunine kindness, and sense of caring by sharing her food, drink, and toys with him even calling him her "best friend" embracing him in a hug before leaving with her mother. After yet more beatings from Brenda simply for eating <i>her</i> food, he'd return back to his room where he'd lament on his situation - namely how he missed his real family.</p>
								<p>Just then, a gust of wind alerted Skye to his open window making him realize he could fit through, after thinking on things Skye packed his bags and lept out the window one goal in mind - find his real family. This would lead Skye to be involved in the Foliage Forestfire Incident, as he'd dash into the burning forest to rescue Andy.</p>

						<h4>Who are the Characters?<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"> </h4>
							<h5>Skye Eugine Dissaith</h5>
								<img src="images/so/Animation - Skye Dissaith.gif"/><p>Skye Dissaith is a young tiger who is in-tune with his own emotions, and introspective towards himself and often in very deep thought. He feels things very deeply, both good and bad but is a natural healer. Skye is rather empathetic, able to understand how others feel based on his past truamas he seeks to be genuinely and authentically himself.</p>
								<p>He can be passionate about his hobbies or things he feels speaks to him. Despite this he can react emotionally at times, cauing him to lash-out even if not his intention. He can also focus on his self-image too much leading him to feel self-doubt and insecure which may lead to him feeling like he's lost control.</p>
							<h5>Andrea "Andy" Naomi Adelle</h5>
								<img src="images/so/Animation - Andy Idle 3.gif"/><p>Andy Adelle is a young fennec woman who's empathetic, kind, and caring she can see many sides of a situation. She has a strong sense of purpose believing she's alive to assist others she has a strong desire to give back to her community and improve the lives of people around her. She tends to not be very judgemental and seeks to understand that person first, and often shares her empathetic side in these situations.</p>
								<p>She has little tolerance for people who don't seem to care how their actions affect others and understand what led them to act that way. However she may overlook her own needs in favor of others, often be self-critical when she feels like she's failed someone and may come off as cold and aloof when stressed not because she's mad at anyone inparticularly but because she overextended herself.</p>

						<h4>What Platforms?</h4>
							<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"> 
								<p>Current plans are for Windows and Linux, consoles were being considered however I've decided to hild back on that as I wish to maintain my legal rights to the Skye's Origin IP. I'm debating on the license I wish to have for the game and am seeking to pursue a license that keeps the IP open to the public. (I don't mind if you all make fangames or fan-made content).</p>
								<p>Yet, I don't want to be forced to sell the ownership rights to a Triple A Studio which is something you often have to do to get your game on consoles. As such while I initially had plans for Nintendo Switch, and a few other consoles I'll likely hold off on it until I figure something out.</p>

					<div class ="description">
						<h4>Will the game be free? Will it have DRM?</h4>
								<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"> 
									<p>Free? No. You will have to pay for the game, DRM? Also No. Once you buy it you'll be able to play with or without the client of your chosen storefront. I'd even like to include an installer with the game for the PC versions, regardless.</p>
							<h4>How close is it to Completion?</h4>
								<hr style="width: 90%; margin-left:0; border-top: dashed 4px;"> 
									<p>Uh.... sadly no and yes I know - how could I have made so little progress since 2014? Well many things, mainly lazyness. Though there have been a few other things namely lack of resources - for the artwor and story I have more than enough experience to make it myself. Things like Music however is difficult, and while I've made many characters Enemies are things I have yet to implement.</p>
									<p>That and the plot I gave you on this page is an abridged version of the real plot - the actual one is way longer -  long enough to span a few chapters. However it's also in regards to other projects - I can only really work on one however this does not mean the others are cancelled which is a trap many communities fall into.</p>
									<p>Right now though I'm considering remaking Old Levels for the game, and working on some enemy designs. As for in-engine work I still have as of yet to make an actual demo but plans are to make one with story and stuff in mind. But there's more concept stuff needing to be done right now.</p>

<h1>Welcome to Tygarts!</h1>
<h2 style = "font-size: 14px;">Quality Games for Quality Gamers</h2>

		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Since I was born in 1999, I never knew what I wanted to do as a career. That is until I picked up a Nintendo Gamecube Controller at a neighbors house, from there my passion in video games sparked. Since then I've seen many games come and go with many inspiring me to make my own, this led me to opt to go to vocational school where I learned how to make a band.</p> 
		<p>This brand seeks to offer quality DRM-free, video games and artwork that place the player into immersive worlds of imagination. If you wish to see old projects we've worked on then head to the portfolio! If you're just interested in the projects swing by the projects page. Hopefully when you play a Tygarts Game, you'll have fun, laugh and maybe even tear up a bit!</p>

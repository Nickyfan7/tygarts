Those who once lived there have since made new homes on a nearby Island, East, and West City. Time goes by as many generations pass including Gerem and Dr. Ucano who eventually pass away.</li>
			<li>Many Areas change over time - Force Fortress is overtaken by nature renamed to "Fused Force". The Leaf Land resistance base is tore down and replaced with a Train Station now called "Angel Terminal", the New Castle is broken and dilpataded now being called "Old Castle"</li>
			<li>As time marches on the events that transpired erode into a mere fleeting memory as the history of the South Lakes and Sky Empire now elude even the locals. During this time things seemed peaceful until incidents began poping up first the South Island, Flower Mountain Land, Westisde Island, Mainland (again).

			<li>Sonic, after his latest adventure on Angel Island, decided to take a vacation, leading him to Revisit the South Lakes (unbeknownst to him at the time) where after going on a run he encounters an old foe from the Second Mainland Incident - EGGATS-2013 who flings him into the past.</li>

			<li>EGGATS-2013 approaches rapidly as Dr. Eggman attempts to capture it only to be sent to the Past. Sonic and Rodolia escape the trap and find a location marked on the map in Eggman's Computer and head over to incestigate finding a portal they can use to go to the <a href = "#Sonic's Arrival">Past.</a></li>
			<li>After some shenanigans in the <a href = "#Sonic's Arrival">Past</a>. Sonic, Rodolia, and Gerem return to the present, with Sonic and Rodolia landing in Wild Wave, while Gerem lands unconsious on the Island. Sonic and Rodolia noting how it now houses an amusement park and head over to investigate there they find one of EGGATS-2013's feathers and a message by one of Eggman's Robots - Eggmyte.</li>
			<li>They explore and soon run into Eggmyte before being challenged to a Fight, they defeat him, and climb a nearby tower where they find Gerem at the top, as they drag him into the <a href ="#Sonic's Arrival">Past</a> once more.

Over?" ring in his mind as he explores the remains of the Sky Empire now knowing the full story behind it and the South Lakes.</li>
			<li>Sonic soon runs off on his next adventure hearing murmurs around the South Lakes of how Little Planet is soon to make it's annual reappearance and decides to take a shortcut through Flower Mountain Land to Never Lake.</li>

		<h3>Ripped from Time</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>After many adventures, Sonic returns on a run through South Island's Green Hill things seeming peaceful... almost <i>too</i> peaceful. Low and behold the peace doesn't last for long as Sonic feels a tremor - though intially assumes it's an earthquake and shrugs it off.</li>
			<li>Soon however he hears a roar from behind him looking in the direction of the roar he finds it's source - the Time Eater - a creature capable of erasing time and space soon the colors of Green Hill begin to turn pure white with anything caught in it being petrified.</li>
			<li>Sonic soon awakens in a White Limbo seeing a familiar orange presence in the distance he finds Tails - though somehow different than he remembers. "Wow, you weren't kidding when you said soon! I thought you already left!" Sonic makes his way to Chemical Plane leaving Tails pondering.</li>
			<li>Sonic soon rescues the various others who were petrified, and enters the Death Egg - now back after the Westside Island, Angel Island, and Mainland Incidents. There he finds an odd mirror and looks into it. "Take a good look at yourself Sonic! It's the last look you'll get before I close your eyes forever!"</li>
			<li>Sonic dashes off hearing - "Another Sonic? Wait a second!" before the gate closes behind him. Sonic faces off against the Death Egg Robot, just as he's about to land the final blow - Dr. Eggman's kidnapped! The weirdness doesn't end either as Sonic exits to find - his reflection?</li>
			<li>After some mild confusion Tails makes the situation clear - they're traveling across space and time. Revealing the "reflection" to be Sonic's Future Self - Modern Sonic. The Time Eater flies by as Sonic and Modern Sonic, follow it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Time in Danger</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sonic and Modern Sonic restore  Speed Highway and City Escape before Tails and Modern Tails propose the theory that the Time Eater is what's petrifiying the areas they've visited. They restore Seaside Hill, as Modern Sonic faces off against a foe of his past.</li>
			<li>Modern Sonic exits after it's defeat as Tails congratulates him with Modern Tails correcting him. The Time Eater flies overhead and goes for the Petrified Chaos Emerald only for it to wince in pain at the Emerald.</li>
			<li>Sonic and Modern Sonic seek a way to restore the Emerald from petrification. After restoring Crisis City, Rooftop Run, and Planet Wisp they restore the Chaos Emerald and run for it as Modern Sonic uses the Air Dash to grab it.</li>
			<li>Modern Sonic takes on and defeats an enemy of his recent past with Tails, Modern Tails, and Sonic joining before Dr. Eggman is kidnapped once again. It's not long before they encounter the Time Eater revealed to be piloted by Dr. Eggman and Modern Eggman.</li>
			<li>Modern Eggman explains how he discovered the Time Eater after his latest defeat in Modern Sonic's <a href="#Sonic Colors">last adventure</a>. Before knocking them both unconsious - using the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic and Modern Sonic become Super Sonic and Modern Super Sonic.</li>
			<li>Sonic and Modern Sonic return to Modern Sonic's time and celebrate their birthday, eventually Sonic demonstrates his attempt at the Air Dash before jumping into the portal leading back to Green Hill</li>

This Plant also appears in TailsTube #5 (Remember When?). </li>
				<li><b>Metarex Saga:</b> The version of the Metarex Saga that occurs in the SEGASonic universe likely differs from the one seen in Sonic X with one difference likely being the abscence of Chris Thorndyke, depsite his abscence the fact Tails has Cosmos plant fonfirms she was still present. Another difference would likely be that Shadow still has his memories unlike X as the most likely time for this to occur while still being in line with X is after <i>Sonic Battle</i> which takes place after <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i> by then, Shadow has gotten his memories back as confirmed by <i>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings</i>. </li>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The universe in which Shogakukans Dash & Spin Super Fast Sonic Series of Manga occurs. This universe Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy take on Dr. Eggman in his various misdeeds usually comedically defeating him in his antics with him doing things like Robbing Banks, Pulling Scams, Stealing things with a crane, and seeking sunken treasures. This universe has somewhat of a comedic and shocking edge to it as it's the only piece of Sonic media outside of the game <i>Shadow the Hedgehog</i> where the cast has been known to swear albeit to a lesser extent than in that game.</p>

Furthermore Amy Rose mentions her in <i>Sonic Frontiers</i> alongside Cream both of these things confirm that Sticks the Badger has a counterpart in the <i>SEGASonic the Hedgehog</i> Universe.</li>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The universe in which Issues 0 - 251 of Archie Comics Sonic the Hedgehog Comic Series occurs. This universe was erased by Dr. Eggman and Dr. Wily activating the Super Genesis Wave and irreversably re-writing reality. In this universe various Echidna characters belonging to Ken Penders such as Athair, Lein-Da, and Julie-Su exist these characters would be erased by the Super Genesis Wave. In early issues the characters, Sonic's history, and worldbuilding were sourced from the <i>Sonic SatAM</i> Universe but over it's run incorporated more characters from the SEGASonic the Hedgehog Universe such as Shadow, Silver, Omega, Rouge, etcetra. This seems to make this universe somewhat of a "Mixing Pot" between SatAM, Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, and SEGASonic.</p>

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The mini-multiverse in which the any Non-Sega and Non-Sonic media featuring Sonic or having their own version of Sonic occurs. There are various universes within this mini-multiverse as such there is no story as the stories of these iterations of Sonic is often unclear though its to be assumed that they go through the same events as the <i>SEGASonic the Hedgehog</i> Universe until something causes them to deviate into the events of the media that Sonic is featured in. It's worth noting however this is not true for all Sonic's in this universe such as Wreck-it-Ralph's Sonic who exists in an acrade - meaning while he's experinced <i>Sonic the Hedgehog (Mega Play)</i>,<i>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (Mega Play)</i> and <i>SEGASonic the Hedgehog</i> he likely skipped games that do not have Arcade versions such as <i>Sonic 3 & Knuckles</i> .</p>

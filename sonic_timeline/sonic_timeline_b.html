     <div id="logo" style ="text-align: center"><h2 style ="font-family: Righteous"><b>The Beginning of the Multiverse/Origin of the Chaos Emeralds (??? B.S.)</b></h2></div>
	  <hr style="border: 2px dashed black;" />
	  <p>An unquantifiable amount of time ago there was a void that housed an unfathomable energy, reaching critical mass however this ball of energy exploded and with it the multiverse was born - at its center rested a universe known as SegaSonic home to the planets of Earth, The Lost Hex, Little Planet, and a planet known as “Homeworld” to the race that lived there. Also created were 8 gems - these were the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald.</p>
	  <p>The Chaos Emeralds held infinite power and could transform an individual's thoughts into power, the Master Emerald acting as the controller to the other 7 being capable of empowering and depowering the Chaos Emeralds it’s said the Master Emerald is the most powerful object in the universe with its power transcending even the infinite power of the Chaos Emeralds. These emeralds would drift through space until they’d eventually end up on different planets.</p>
	  <p>Also created in the explosion were various entities those being The End, Light and Dark Gaia, the former created in a state of slumber to awaken every 1,000 years for the Time of Awakening - an event in which Dark Gaia would lay waste to the Planet Earth after which Light Gaia would lull Dark Gaia back into slumber and restore the planet. The End however saw all of creation as chaotic in nature and sought to bring it to order by destroying it.</p>
          <p>On Homeworld existed a race of beings made of a watery liquid eventually called the Ancients, existed in 5 tribes and would eventually discover the Chaos Emeralds on their planet soon after they’d be given visions of their planet’s destruction - a premonition of events to come, the most Intelligent among them began development on technology known as the Chaos Engines - Engines using the emeralds to power the device it was used on attaching them to space ships to prepare for incoming doom.</p>
          <p>The Intelligent beings escaped the planet as The End arrived destroying the planet mere moments after their escape, leaving the remaining Ancients drifting through space seeking a new home planet eventually the Chaos Emeralds would react to the Master Emerald back on Earth - the Ancients taking note of this followed the Chaos Emeralds reaction which soon led them to the Starfall Islands on Earth, here they began rebuilding their society developing new technology a digital dimension that could archive their minds.</p>
	  <p>Fearing the return of The End they would build giant mechs they dubbed Titans based on the tribes of their home planet in preparation to fight should The End ever return, sure enough The End soon arrived and began attacking the remaining Ancients who mobilized the Titans to fight it off despite the immense power of the Titans however The End was stronger having little to no choice one of the pilots - Crane piloting the Titan Supreme would bind The End to his titan at the cost of his life.</p>
          <p>The other pilots Dragon, Snake, and Tiger carry out their backup plan - sealing The End in Cyber Space, back on Earth the remaining Ancients would flee to an area in the Mystic Ruins, taking the Master Emerald with them this land eventually becoming the future home to the gem - eons pass while some of the Ancient pass away infusing their memories into the charm they carried with them others would have their DNA deteriorate over time thanks to exposure to the Master Emerald creating new creatures known as the Chao and Koco.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere on a distant unnamed island a jungle would begin to grow; this jungle would eventually be named “Meta Junglira” and be a location that an important figure of the future would visit on one of their adventures.</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Sonic flies in search of an Island, this being the same Island he saw in his vision and on his last adventure and lands his plane on the phantom island of Westside. An island with an ancient civilization that used a “Miracle Stone” to achieve prosperity when their civilization collapsed overnight due to its abuse - the gods sealing it away.
		<ul>
		<li><b><u>SO + Manual:</u></b> In the manual it’s said that “Sonic happened to discover the island during his usual carefree adventure.” The adventure being referred to was Sonic CD, as Sonic would see Westside Island as he was on Little Planet which was high in the air. Sonic Origins further supports this as the series of events would be Sonic CD:Ending  > Sonic CD: Epilogue (Origins) > Sonic 2 Prologue.</li>
		<li><b><u>Sonic 1 + Manual:</u></b> In Sonic 1 there were only 6 Chaos Emeralds but in Sonic 2 there are 7 the manual explains a bit about Westside Island’s History  and how the ancients of the Island used a “Miracle Stone” which ended up being the 7th Emerald.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>A few days after landing on the Island, Sonic was on a run when he saw some bullies picking on a fox kid calling him “Tails”, Sonic rushed past them leaving them in a daze.  The young resident wanting to be cool like Sonic followed him. Unbeknownst to both, Dr. Eggman was tracking them.
		<ul>
		<li><b><u>SO + Manual:</u></b> In the manual it's said that Tails was bullied for his two tails, giving him the nickname “Tails”, Sonic Origins expands on this denoting that they’d pull on his Tails to cause him discomfort that being the incident Sonic witnessed.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Tails eventually comes upon Sonic’s Bi-Plane, and begins to inspect it, as the forest is attacked soon after both of them proceed to run off as they enter the Emerald Hill Zone, and make their way across the Island thinking they have Dr. Eggman cornered only for him to take to the skies with them giving chase. Tails is shot down in the Ariel Scuffle but repairs the plane just in time as Sonic and Dr. Eggman board the Death Egg.</li>
		<li>Sonic takes on Mecha Sonic Mk. I and the Death Egg Robot defeating them both as the vessel explodes Sonic escapes out a nearby Airlock where as he falls to the earth he uses the Chaos Emeralds power as Super Sonic is born and he flies by the side of his best buddy.</li>

		<li>Knuckles is guarding the Master Emerald, when the Emerald Idols suddenly begin to vibrate and teleport back to the Special Zone throwing Knuckles off the altar unconscious, when he awakens he notices the Death Egg confusing it with the egg of a dragon he saw in a mural once said to bring doomsday.
		<ul>
		<li><b><u>Sonic Adventure:</u></b> In Lost World that mural can be seen revealing the dragon to be Perfect Chaos.</li>
		<li><b><u>Emerald Conundrum:</u></b> In short: Sonic 3’s Manual, Sonic Origins, Developer Word, and Old Lore disagrees on things which results in the manuals claiming that Knuckles guards the “Chaos Emeralds” to be put under heavy debate. This is because in Old Lore there were multiple sets, in Origins this was retconned to just 2 sets of 7, and developer word constantly shifts on the Super Emeralds canonicity.</li>
		<li><b><u>Emerald Conundrum (CONT):</u></b> o to make this simple the Chaos Emeralds are said to be metaphysical objects with each set being a potential “conduit” for their energy. In Sonic Rivals it’s established via the Master Emerald, that 2 Conduit sets can’t be in the same point of Space-Time if such is the case one will disappear to accommodate the other, meaning multiple can exist but only 1 can be the active conduit, this is likely what happens to Knuckles as Sonic closes in on Angel Island.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Knuckles, guarding the area, eventually explores the island entering the Mushroom Hill Zone, seeing Dr. Eggman, through the bushes catching him off-guard. Knuckles reveals himself to be guardian, leading Eggman to warn him of Sonic. In response Knuckles moves the Master Emerald to the underground altar in Hidden Palace.
		<ul>
		<li><b><u>S2 (2013):</u></b> Shows Dr. Eggman Stomping after landing on the Island as he doesn’t know of any Emeralds on the Island - he has no plan.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b><u>Manual + SO:</u></b> Dr. Eggman finds a Chaos Emerald signal and begins turning animals into robots and using the Jet Mobile to make the conditions on the Island much harsher before using the remains of the Death Egg Robot to enter Hidden Place to grab the Master Emerald arousing Knuckles suspicions only for Eggman to remind Knuckles of Sonic.</li>

		<hr style="border: 2px dashed black;" />
		<p style = "font-family:barlow">After Sonic’s adventure on Westside Island,the Death Egg is now crashing to the ground, in the collision path of the Death Egg was was a huge floating island encased in a chunk of clouds, now a fireball - the Death Egg crashed into the floating island causing immense destruction scattering rings, the impact altered the Island’s path sending it towards the ocean below resulting in a tsunami! Despite this the Island didn’t sink - it simply rested on the ocean’s surface as if nothing had happened.<br/><br/>
		A few days later… on an Island far away from where the collision between the Death Egg and Angel Island took place - Miles “Tails” Prower picked up the sudden onset of a powerful Chaos Emerald signal  with his Jewel Radar believing it to have something to do with the tsunami, Tails went to the beach to find Sonic.<br/><br/>
		Sonic was indeed where Tails predicted he’d be - taking a nap on the beach when Sonic awoke he found a small ring had washed ashore that was engraved with ancient writings, upon picking it up Sonic recalled an old legend about an Island. A long time ago this Island was still part of the continent, and on it lived a powerful civilization of people who used a “Power Stone” to achieve a prosperous and peaceful society. One day a group of elders who wanted to take the power of the stone for themselves - accidentally let the power run wild.<br/><br/>
		In an instant the civilization was destroyed and forgotten by history, it’s been said that after this event the gods descended from the sky and restored a part of the civilization to the Island and released it and the “Power Stone” into the sky. This was the legend of the Island and the ring that washed ashore - this was the legend of the Island sealed off by the gods, the legend of Angel Island. Sonic feeling nostalgic and excited, prepared for a new adventure.<br/><br/>
		Knuckles was patrolling the altar of the Island as usual; it was his job to protect the Seven Chaos Emeralds that control the power of the “Pillar”. However, without warning as Knuckles was inspecting one of the Chaos Emeralds it suddenly began to vibrate, the vibrations grew more and more intense just as they hit their peak there was a flash of light with a screech. Knuckles’s memory was blacked out as he felt his body float away, when he regained consciousness he had been flung outside the altar and looked around only to find it destroyed.<br/><br/>
		He rushed to the altar where he noticed- the Chaos Emeralds had disappeared! Knuckles then walked out of the altar when he felt something eerie appearing around the lake feeling a shiver down his spine looking at the Egg-Shaped object believing it to be the Egg of the Legendary Dragon as depicted on a mural near the Chaos Emeralds altar  Knuckles spent the next few days patrolling the Chaos Emeralds altar when suddenly wreckage started falling from above!<br/><br/>
		Knuckles dodged them all only to find an egg shaped man burst from the Robot. Dr. Eggman indeed was frustrated at another plan’s failure by the hands of Sonic to the point of expressing it physically - before seeing the Master Emerald! In awe at it he approached before Knuckles intervened, ready to engage in battle letting slip he was its guardian. Knuckles was about to punch Dr. Eggman, demanding  he leave the island now, when Dr.Eggman pleaded for a chance to explain himself.<br/><br/> 
		Knuckles begrudgingly gave him said chance Dr. Eggman claimed he was here to Study the Egg on the Island, when he encountered an evil duo named Sonic and Tails, who had targeted the Chaos Emeralds on the Island. Knuckles thought over this for a bit - not wanting to take any chances - Knuckles agreed to help Dr. Eggman with Sonic and Tails.  A few days after escaping from the Death Egg Dr. Eggman discovered that the Island indeed did have some Chaos Emeralds that lay dormant and began construction on the Launch Base Zone to obtain them, even changing the nature of the Island with his environment manipulation machine.<br/><br/>
		Dr. Eggman was now fully ready for Sonic’s arrival and with Knuckles by his side the stage had been set it seemed almost as if nothing could stop Dr. Eggman as he laughed with joy as he proceeded to challenge Sonic under his breath.<br/><br/>
		</p>
		<h3 style ="font-family: Righteous">Story</h3>
		<hr style="border: 2px dashed black;" />
		<p style = "font-family: barlow">Sonic and Tails board the Tornado and head towards the location of the Tsunami, finding an Island in its place, Sonic jumps off the Tornado, transforms into Super Sonic and arrives on the Island only to be ambushed by Knuckles the Echidna. Knuckles steals the Chaos Emeralds and leaves mocking them by laughing in their face. It’s now up to Sonic and Tails to venture into this foreign land and show Knuckles who the real bad guy is.<br/><br/>
		Sonic and Tails make their way across the Island and collect the 7 Chaos Emeralds only to fall into Knuckles’ various traps around the Island as the duo eventually storm Dr. Eggman’s Launch Base where they have a brief encounter with Knuckles before facing off against Dr. Eggman piloting 3 machines - the Ball Shooter, Beam Rocket, and Big Arm, Sonic defeats them all as Dr. Eggman retreats to the now falling Death Egg which crash lands back on Angel Island.<br/><br/>
		Tails flies Sonic off the platform and into a nearby forest where the duo stumble across Knuckles who presses a nearby switch closing an entranceway he came from Sonic and Tails press the switch, inside they find a Super Ring and go inside and are teleported to Hidden Palace where the Emeralds are taken from Sonic and Tails with the Chaos Emerald Idols being summoned in their powerless state.<br/><br/>
		Sonic and Tails through Subspace manage to project the Chaos Emerald energy through the Idol that power thus gets spiked by the Master Emerald birthing the first of the Super Emeralds. The duo continue their journey through the Island and continue to project the Chaos Emeralds’ Energy through the Chaos Emerald Idols as the Master Emerald spikes each into a Super Emerald .<br/><br/>
		Eventually Sonic and Tails make their way to Hidden Palace where they face off against Knuckles after his defeat Knuckles soon finds his so-called “ally” Dr. Eggman stealing the Master Emerald! Knuckles attempts to stop him only to be electrocuted. The floor gives way leaving the trio trapped. Knuckles soon awakens and breaks down a wall Sonic and Tails couldn't, leading them to a secret teleporter that leads them to the ancient floating ruins of Sky Sanctuary.<br/><br/> 
		There they find the Death Egg departing for space Sonic and Tails run off after the Death Egg.  Knuckles returns to Angel Island wondering if Sonic can truly get the Emerald back - no he has to. Sonic takes on Mecha Sonic MK.III and defeats him before the floor again collapses Sonic and Tails jump onto the tower next to them and climb it as it too collapses jumping off towards the Death Egg, Tails grabs Sonic and the duo board the vessel.<br/><br/>
		They make their way through the Death Egg and after taking down Death Ball, Dr. Eggman flees to the Kyodai Eggman Robo powered by the Master Emerald and defeats it, Dr. Eggman flees with the Emerald as Sonic and Tails give chase. They defeat his Egg-o-Matic but Dr. Eggman escapes into space with the Emerald, Sonic transforms into Hyper Sonic and goes off at speeds faster than Super Sonic to get the Master Emerald back, Tails returns to Earth to once again ready the Tornado.<br/><br/>
		Sonic weaves through the Asteroid Belts to catch up to Dr. Eggman defeating his Final Weapon and reclaiming the Master Emerald he then returns to the Earth as Tails catches Sonic who phases out of Hyper Sonic however oddly finds he feels… stronger than before? He shrugs this feeling off as he and Tails return the Master Emerald to Angel Island and Knuckles sees them off.<br/><br/>
		Back in Hidden Palace however, the strain of Sonic’s Hyper Transformation, and the spiked Chaos Emeralds Energy causes Super Forms and the Chaos Emeralds to be boosted in power, lose their color again and crack as the Chaos Emeralds energy manifests back into their physical forms before scattering  yet again.<br/><br/>
		Out in the sea however floats Dr. Eggman who sits on a floatie based on his very own Rexxon Badnik in defeat When he suddenly is joined by a Flicky - the same one he captured on South Island he attempts to swat it away the flicky in retaliation pops his floatie with its beak forcing Dr. Eggman to swim, to land to hatch his next big plan. Meanwhile a surviving Egg Robo awakens back in Sky Sanctuary...<br/><br/>

		<p style = "font-family: barlow">Sonic has reclaimed the Master Emerald and returned it to Angel Island, causing it to rise into the sky once more however unbeknownst to him there was a badnik he failed to destroy - an Egg Robo that camouflage itself in the parts of other destroyed Egg Robos hoping to trick Sonic into believing it was destroyed - to which it succeeded before receiving a transmission from another robot- Mecha Sonic MK.III it fulfilled this request.<br/><br/>
		Meanwhile, Knuckles is in Mushroom Hill napping under a Mushroom when he awakens to find a device in front of him which happens to be a bomb that explodes when he goes to take a closer look Eggrobo then reveals himself Knuckles gives chase to it where it then leads him back to the beachside before losing him, Knuckles thus begins his journey to take care of the straggler badniks on his Island he succeeds in doing so making his way to the destroyed Sky Sanctuary.<br/><br/>
		Once there he faces off against Mecha Sonic MK.III who survived his fight with Sonic, he defeats him but the Robot then reveals he stole the Master Emerald - he used the power of the stolen Master Emerald to become Super Mecha Sonic, which Knuckles takes on in a fight and defeats it Mecha Sonic MK.III finally explodes into pieces as the area of Sky Sanctuary Knuckles is in gives way. Knuckles however is caught by Sonic who was happening to fly by in his Bi-Plane.<br/><br/>
		With the Master Emerald re-claimed Sonic and Knuckles return the gem to Angel Island which was slowly falling during the fight this in turn causes the Island to not only float but fly slightly higher in the sky.

		<p style = "font-family: barlow">While Knuckles is dealing with Eggrobo and Mecha Sonic, Dr. Eggman soon floats ashore on a Volcanous Island and quickly begins building the Veg-o-Fortress and builds it with a Pinball Defense system in hopes of disorienting Sonic using the Chaos Emeralds to enhance the magma powering the fortress.<br/><br/>
		the sudden appearance of the fortress causes people from nearby Islands to panic as Sonic and Tails board a modified Tornado and over suspecting Dr. Eggman of using the Chaos Emeralds to power it. "This one's a little tougher, but once we get the Chaos Emeralds out of the system, we're in business!" Sonic said as they honed in. <br/><br/>
		"Take care, Sonic! I wish you the best!" Tails replied before suddenly... lasers everywhere! Tails swerved trying to dodge, Sonic however lost his footing as he fell into the watery depths below. Eventually he made his way inside the fortress via an undergound cave system, taking down the Scorpius and the Robo Boiler as he climbed the volcano.<br/><br/>
		Something clearly wasn't right, he was sure there were only 7, but with no time to dwell on it Sonic soon reached the core of the Veg-o-Fortress finding Dr. Eggman doing the old classic - Animals to Robots schtick destroying the machine from the inside out as Dr. Eggman launched the Fortress into Space. 
		Sonic took the fight to Dr. Eggman and defeating him as the fortress exploded causing Sonic and Dr.Eggman to fall where Sonic was caught by Tails in the tornado while Eggman fell into the Volcano.

		<p style = "font-family: barlow">Sonic and Tails rode off as Sonic found it useful he collected all... "16 Emeralds?!" something... wasn't right shouldn't there have only been seven curious Sonic handed the collected Emeralds to Tails to study hopefully if anyone he could make sense of it.<br/><br/> Tails agreed to look into it later as he was too busy at the moment, but would look into it when the time presented itself.

		<p style = "font-family: barlow">Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles reunite and head off to Flicky Island, said to now be the new resting spot of the Chaos Emeralds. A satellite in the Sky was spying on the Island. "I've finally found Flicky Island, home of the Chaos Emeralds!" said Dr. Eggman, once again after the Gems.<br/><br/>
		Dr. Eggman departed for the island with intent to capture the Flickies to use in Badniks only to find nothing but quiet forests and mountains "What's going on with this island?! There's no Flickies anywhere!" He said frustrated until a ring opened before him out came Flickies who rested on a tree and began to eat some nuts before returning. "Hahah, I found out the Flickies' secret."<br/><br/>
		as he then knew the Flickies were using the rings to travel through subspace. So he got to work and soon completed the "Big Ring Generating Machine" which he used to capture the Flickies imprisioning them in his Badniks. Sonic, Tails and Knuckles arrived on the Island soon after to find the place swarming with Robots, which Sonic wasted no time in defeating for the flickies inside to confirm their suspicions.<br/><br/>
		The Flickies taught Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles how to use the Big Rings, as Sonic made his way across the Green Grove Zone where he soon found Dr. Eggman "Eggman! What are you doing over there?!" Sonic growled as Dr. Eggman responded "You again, Sonic. How impudent. You can't stop me now. I'll get all the Chaos Emeralds and conquer the world. Daahahahahah!"<br/><br/>
		Sonic made his way through the Green Groves, Diamond-like Glaciers, Rusty Ruins, and to Dr. Eggman's Fortress the Gene Gadget all whilst collecting the Chaos Emeralds and freeing his friends. However he found Dr. Eggman escaped into his own Subspace, to which he quickly gave pursuit facing off against the Doctor, he defeated him returning to his own dimension where the Flickies thanked Sonic, and co grateful for their help.<br/><br/>
		Knuckles returned to Angel Island, while Sonic took Tails on his return visit to South Island.
